# CYW955572BTEVK-01

### Overview

The Cypress CYW955572BTEVK-01 Evaluation Kit enables you to evaluate and develop single-chip Bluetooth applications using the CYW55572, an ultra-low-power dual-mode Bluetooth 5.2 wireless MCU device. The CYW55572 is a stand-alone baseband processor with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting Bluetooth LE. The CYW55572 employs high integration to reduce external components, thereby minimizing the device's footprint and cost. This kit helps evaluate device functionality and develop applications quickly for faster time-to-market.

* CYW55572 FCBGA - M.2 30x30mm form-factor, iPA/iLNA, BT5.2 board
* Audio Arduino shield with on-board analog microphones, audio codec chip, headphone and speaker output
* On-board sensors â€“ an ambient light sensor, thermistor, and footprint for an Infineon digital microphone
* USB connector for power, programming and USB-UART bridge

### Kit Contents

* CYW9BTM2BASE1 base board
* CYW955572M2BT Bluetooth radio card (mounted on the base board)
* CYW9BT Audio 3 Arduino shield (pre-assembled on top of the CYW9BTM2BASE1)
* USB Standard-A to Micro-B cable
* Power Adapter

### Additional Information

* Max UART baud rate is 3M.
* ADC\_INPUT\_P0 used in the hal/adc code example routes to D7 on the board, J4 pin 1. when the AUDIO3 shield is used, this routes to the CUSTOM button on the shield.
